# Lab Report: Bookbinding

#### ADRIANA MESSINA

## Process Description

When we got to class, we were greeted with a spread of bookbinding tools, including a bonefolder, an awl, a needle, scissors, and a pencil, all on a cutting mat. We passed out our Twitterbot book's pages and carefully folded them into folios, using the bonefolder to make crisp lines. Between the 2 pages of poems, with *recto* and *verso*, we each had 8 pages and a cardstock cover. Then I took my inner page, and measured 5 numbered stations. The stations are holes in the gutter of the codex, where the threads are sewn to hold the book together. I made the middle station at 4.25in then went out 1.5 inches each way to make the rest of the stations. I placed this inner page within the other page and cover, then placed everything into a cradle.

After making sure everything was aligned, I used an awl to poke through all the pages and the cover. By moving in from along the side I could align the awl with the pencil marks, then push all the way through to make precise holes. I threaded my needle with waxed thread and followed the sewing pattern shown below to bind the pages.

When I was done carefully sewing, I tied my string in a double knot and cut the excess thread. With just those few fairly simple steps, I had bound a book!

## Observations

What surprised me most about this lab was how deceptively simple it was. Once I got my bearings, it was fairly easy to follow along with the given instructions. My familiarity with handmade books and zines probably helped, and my newfound love of embroidery definitely gave me a more inherent understanding of the sewing process. With the given diagram, I was fairly quick to get everything sewn, and I could be even quicker if I memorized the pattern. This made the entire process pretty fast, and I can see how easy it would be to bind many books in a short period of time once you got into a groove.

However, the level of precision used during the process contrasted the simplicity of the steps. Each step required some special tool and a lot of precision. These details made me realize how bookbinding can be as simple or skilled as its creator. With a need for such precise hand motions and measurements, each bookbinding professional would have their own specific style and quality choices. I wasn't trying to be perfectly neat, but I can imagine how different the result would be if I took a lot more time to be very precise. I better understand how the quality of book's binding can determine its value and durability, because I realize how much work can go into it if you so choose.

## Analysis

This lab's focus on format reminded me of the Baxter's *Procrustes* reading. Throughout Chesnutt's piece, we never actually learn much about the content of *Procrustes*. The club's focus is almost entirely on how the book looks and how much they can sell it for. Members are reluctant to cut their pages, and the narrator is even specifically given the role of analyizing Baxter's letterpress and bookmaking quality. Baxter printed the blank copies of *Procrustes* to confirm that, "a book with nothing in it was just as useful to a book-collector as one embodying a work of genius" (pg. 792) Clearly, his experiment proved his hypothesis. The books we made, in contrast, were very much about the content and the experience. The binding was so simple that we could all do it with limited knowledge or practice. The covers were simple cardstock, with no fancy inlays or borders. But that does not mean the books are not valuable to us. I am very proud of what I've learned the many steps we took to make these books - from programming Twitterbots, to using the letterpress. Unlike Baxters book, the experience is what gave our books value, not the material quality.

Price's "Interleaf: Please Lay Flat" chapter in *What We Talk About When We Talk About Books* also came to mind during this lab. As infuriating as the interleaf was, it got me thinking about the power of the format of a codex. By making her audience read across the gutter, Price puts us in a strangely uncomfortable position. I often lost my place, got tripped up, or realized I'd read a page without processing any of the words on it. During our discussion, it became clear that my classmates felt similarly. The format of this chapter allowed it to hold power over its readers, making them work hard just to gain access to its words. This power through format is something that really interests me. When making our own books, we also had that power. We could make the choice at any time to go off the rails and get creative with our bookbinding. Now that I know the basics, I have the power to format my unessays however I like. I can force my audience into a similarly uncomfortable position as Price does, revealing my intent through showing instead of telling.

Intentional and specific formatting choices are very important to my artist's book unessay. The choices I have made in how to present it - folio style, on felt, decorated with fabric, and filled with embroidered words - is definitely specific to my concept. I want to make a satirical comment on dead media by sewing their obituaries in a flowery pink book. My approach is very "end of media history", with the deaths of certain media making room for "new" and "better" media. I enjoy the irony of a book about this morbid concept being purposely soft, pretty, and girly. If I presented it in another format, this irony would be lost. In this case, the format I chose directly reflects what I am talking about and the tone I am going for, just as it did for Baxter and Price.
