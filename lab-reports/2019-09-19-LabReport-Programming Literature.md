# Lab Report: PROGRAMMING LITERATURE
#### Adriana Messina

## Process Description

In this week’s lab, I created Twitter bots to randomly generate and tweet out stanzas of poetry based on a string of JSON code that I wrote and a poem that I chose. In my case, I chose song lyrics from Watsky’s “Love Letters” because I wanted to see how a bot would work with some complicated syntax and whimsical themes. We started our lab by looking at other Twitter bots and discussing their structure, then working on Tracery and learning about JSON programming. Once I felt I understood the idea of creating categories for Tracery to pull words from to construct into the origin format, I started messing around with Tracery. Starting with just the first line of my stanza for my origin, I broke down the phrase into its pieces and created labels for each one (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), then filled each label with a few words just to see if it worked. Unfortunately, it didn’t. I tried a lot of different fixes and checked my syntax over and over, and eventually realized that copy-pasting my code from Markdown to Tracery was somehow confusing the system. Once I rewrote it by hand, everything worked as planned! I repeated this process for each line of my stanza, extending the origin and creating new labels as new word forms were introduced, while tracking my code’s growth in Markdown. ![Markdown Code Tracking](file:///Users/Adriana/Documents/NU%20Work/3rd%20Year/Tech.%20of%20Text/GitHub/f19-technologies-of-text-messina-a/images/Programming%20Lit%203.png)Finally my code was completed and my categories were filled with enough words to get good variation in my rerolls. I entered my code into “Cheap Bots, Done Quick!” to make sure that my syntax was all correct, and made a few adjustments here and there to make my rerolls sound as sensical and natural as possible. Once I was happy with how everything looked, I set my bot to tweet every 3 hours and let is run overnight. The next morning, I saw that my Tweets were going through properly and there were no obvious repeats. However, I did have some trouble with my line breaks not appearing, which I definitely wanted to fix. After researching trying a few different ways to program line breaks, I found one that appeared to work when I entered it into “Cheap Bots” as seen below. ![Cheap Bots Code](file:///Users/Adriana/Documents/NU%20Work/3rd%20Year/Tech.%20of%20Text/GitHub/f19-technologies-of-text-messina-a/images/Programming%20Lit%201.png)

 Unfortunately this effect was not replicated in my actual tweets and I was unsure as to why. I tried troubleshooting for a while and then realized that “Cheap Bots” actually told me the proper sequence for line breaks. (\n) Ultimately, I got my poems looking how I wanted them to, and I’m really happy with how well my bot turned out. ![Final tweets](file:///Users/Adriana/Documents/NU%20Work/3rd%20Year/Tech.%20of%20Text/GitHub/f19-technologies-of-text-messina-a/images/Programming%20Lit%202.png)

## Observations

Something I really liked about this lab was the amount of detail-work and creativity I got to exercise while programming JSON data. Tracery’s interface was intuitive and made it easy to see what changes I was making, but it didn’t help me much if I made a mistake. It simply would turn my origin red in the output box and leave me to figure out what I did wrong. However, I didn’t really mind having to look for mistakes. Honestly, there was something very satisfying about fixing a misplaced comma and suddenly seeing my origin text being accurately displayed. I liked having to watch out for the details in my syntax to make sure everything worked as planned, and enjoyed adding new layers and watching them succeed after working hard on them. I also liked getting to choose what words my bot would have to choose from in each labeled category. Sometimes I would add a word, then see it get rolled and realize it didn’t really work in my poem. I ended up swapping a lot of words in and out, and I’m happy with the variety I ended up with.Overall, I really loved the overlap of grammar and programming that I got to see and utilize during this lab. I’m currently in a Style and Editing class, and we’ve discussed parts of speech to great length, so it was really cool to see how a bot’s “brain” would have to break down grammar in order to build phrases and sentences. Humans hardly ever think about it but grammar is really difficult to understand and master; but the way it is translated into JSON syntax is really easy to recognize and manipulate. I never really though about how a bot reads or writes, and always assumed it was something too complicated for me to understand. Obviously what we did in this lab was at a pretty basic level of programming, but I do feel like I have a better grasp of how bots work. Now, I really want to try creating some more complicated bots like the examples we looked at. I’m a big fan of Shakespeare, and the @pentametron Twitter bot really cracked me up, so I might look into making something similar to that for a future Unessay.

## Analysis

This lab made me think of many of the points brought up by Ælfric in _Preface to his Translation of Genesis_. In his inscription, he talked of the risk he takes on by translating the Old Testament from Latin into English. Namely that the words will end up in the wrong hands, or that someone will, as Ælfric puts it, “brings it to error through lesser scribes”. If his work is misinterpreted or misused, he will be to blame for being the original translator. When translating a poem from English into JSON code, there is almost a similar type of risk. Bots are fun to make and can be really thought provoking, educational, and funny. Unfortunately, not everyone is seeking to use bots in that way. As long as they have access to a computer, anyone who wants to create a bot from scratch has access to the proper resources; they can create whatever they’d like, even if it is malicious or misleading. However, this doesn’t mean that the technology as a whole isn’t worth it. Ælfric’s translation makes the Old Testament more accessible to those who can’t speak Latin, and bot making makes coding and programming more accessible to those who are still unfamiliar with new technological languages. It’s one of those things that requires a careful balance to make sure it is not being abused, while also keeping it open and accessible.In a similar vein, Vee’s “Computer Programming as Literacy” from _Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming is Changing Writing_ brings up the morality of computer programming and its newfound power in our culture. In 2019, new computational technology is the foundation on which we build our daily lives, from our everyday social interactions to our career choices. And as Vee says, “the idea that programming is connected to literacy is more than a fad.” Computational thinking is a newly valued skill both in schools and in the working world, and it isn’t going away anytime soon. Computer skills such as programming and coding are being emphasized at every turn as the new important thing to learn in order to keep up with society. It gives us a new way to stylize, organize, and express information in ways that can be both creative and technical. But it is also something that informs our new norms and can reflect what we as a society value most. It could easily be exploited and used to harass, harm, or exclude others, even in small everyday ways. This again brings up the double-sided coin of programming: it can be used as a powerful education tool to advance society, but it can also end up in the wrong hands.I had a really great time learning more about JSON coding, but I can easily see how it could be used maliciously. I can also see how privileged I am to have access to resources like this and to have the opportunity to make myself “literate” in the new language that is computer programming. Unfortunately, technology like this can be difficult to make equitable. While computers inherently make information easier to access, that doesn’t mean that it floats above the social issues we still have in America today. The spread of new technology and equipment is always limited in lower socio-economic groups, especially in minority communities. School systems may not have access to the computers, textbooks, or teachers they need to make sure their students gain this new and crucial form of literacy. If, as Vee suggests, coding and programming become linked with morality as reading and writing is, people who don’t have the privilege to learn these new skills may be seen as immoral. In the past, and even now, these distinctions have been used to restrict voting rights or limit job opportunities for oppressed peoples. Hopefully, computer technology doesn’t fall to the same fate, but the only way to prevent this is to be aware of our privilege to learn about these things in class and to attempt to share what we learn with others.
