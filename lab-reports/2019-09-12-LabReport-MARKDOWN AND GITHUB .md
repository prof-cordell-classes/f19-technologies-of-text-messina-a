# Lab Report: MARKDOWN AND GITHUB

#### ADRIANA MESSINA

## Process Description

For this week’s lab report, we went through the step-by-step process of creating our Github accounts, familiarizing ourselves with the repository system, and practicing the basics of Markdown syntax. Following along with the class, I signed up for a student Github account and joined our Technologies of Text Fall 2019 classroom so that I could contribute to our shared repository. I got the Github application for my desktop and downloaded MacDown; I chose MacDown so that I could preview my final product while writing in Markdown syntax. I organized all the files on my computer so I could locate everything I needed for this lab and for the class in general. I then created a new Markdown file to begin practicing syntax. Using the Markdown references in the class site, specifically the [interactive Markdown tutorial] (https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), I got a hang of the syntax and played around with a test text, bolding and italicizing words, creating headings and blockquotes, and adding a beautiful picture of a slice of cheesecake. In the end I have a fairly decent showing of my newly- earned skills in Markdown, and was able to commit my test file on Github so I could share it with the class.


## My Observations

To be honest, I assumed this Markdown and Github lab would be a complicated, confusing endeavor. Much to my pleasant surprise however, it ended up being a much more intuitive and fun experience than I expected. As an international affairs student, I typically stay as far away from coding and HTML as possible. When we began the lab, I was little confused as to what plaintext writing was doing in an English class in the first place. At first glance, Github and Markdown looked pretty alien to me and both seemed unrelated to the other things we had talked about in class, specifically about what writing and codices actually are and what they do for us as people. It seemed to be a very impersonal way of creating text, and I really doubted how much I would like it. However, I ended up enjoying the process much more than I expected. It is never easy to start using a new technology, but the resources provided on the class site gave m a solid basis for understanding Markdown syntax, and I was able to get the hang of it fairly quickly. Markdown offered me a lot more control over my writing and using Github to see when and where I was making changes was undeniably helpful. I had to pay closer attention not just to what I was trying to say with my writing, but also to how I was formatting it while I wrote. It all became one smooth process, instead of multiple separated steps, which helped my ideas to flow much easier without thinking about how I wanted it all to look later on.After this lab, I definitely have a newfound appreciation for the all keyboard shortcuts and little buttons that writing software typically has to make creating my text easier. It gave me pause to have to write in plaintext and having to manually put in syntax to get my text to appear how I wanted it to. Normally it is such a fast and painless process that I don't even have to think about it. When using Markdown, however, I have to think about exactly when and how to change my text. If something doesn’t look the way I want, or if a link or image doesn’t work, I have to troubleshoot why that problem is occurring. This gets me more involved in the creation of my own writing, not just in what it says, but also how it will appear. Markdown is also especially helpful for me thanks to its file type flexibility. I always hate trying to turn a Word document into a PDF, just to have my formatting ruined, especially if that formatting is being counted towards a grade or has to fit within certain boundaries to be printed. Markdown makes it easy to avoid these issues, which ecnourages me to utilize it over the typical Word application. Overall, I can see now how beneficial plaintext writing through Markdown and Github can be when visualizing text and sharing it with others as it changes. While I’m unsure if I’ll ever be a Markdown “devotee”, I am certainly excited to keep using it throughout the class and to better my syntax skills.

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the class’ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.
