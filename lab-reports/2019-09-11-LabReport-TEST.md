# Lab Report: MARKDOWN AND GITHUB _TEST_

## This is Going to Take me a _Very Long Time_ to Master

Wow, this is pretty complicated stuff. I'm definitely going to need to practice my syntax for a while until I get it right. I am definitely not used to writing this - Using Word and GoogleDocs has made me spolied! I guess I could be worse but I'm gonna be practicing this for a _long_ while. Looking forward to when I finally become a **Github Master**!
