# Lab Report: Letterpress I and II

#### ADRIANA MESSINA
## Process Description

In this 2 part lab, our class got to experience the full printing process from start to finish–picking source materials, setting the type, powering the press, and redistributing our fonts back to their cases after the printing was done. To start, I searched through my Twitter bots poetry and eventually found one I liked enough to print. I selected 24-point semi-serif calligraphic as my font, after carefully checking that I’d have enough E types to complete my poem. Using a 20-point lead to start, I began to set my type in the composing stick, being sure to tilt it away from my body to keep the type in place. I set the type right to left, with the nick facing towards me, and checked often to make sure everything was aligned properly. When I finished a line, I placed 24-point pacers at the ends, with larger spacers at the end of the line and then smaller as I approached the text. I then used a smaller lead for between lines, keeping everything evenly lined up as if it was in a book. Once I finished setting all of my type (4 lines total), I carefully moved it off my composing stick and into the galley to store until the next lab class.The following week it was time to begin printing! Prof. Cordell placed four of our poems within a chase to be locked up, and used multiple quoins and many differently sized furniture to secure them. It took some trial and error, but eventually nothing was falling out of the frame and everything was lined up nicely. We brought the chase over to the press and put it in place, gave the press a few practice runs, then start creating our prints. I was first up to power the press, turning the large wheel on the side and then using a bicycle-riding motion on the foot pedal to keep the momentum going. This pushed rollers across the rotating ink plate and down across the type, before pressing our paper into the inked fonts. I got to print seven copes of our poems, stopping between each, and then switched out. When we were finishing the last few prints, Prof. Cordell showed us how a more experienced printer would use the press – without stopping between prints and operating the whole machine alone, which was really crazy to watch. To finish up, we put the prints on a rack to dry, cleaned the ink off of our type, and redistributed our fonts back to their proper cases.

## Observations

Throughout my life, especially my time as a set designer and builder, I have realized that there is something really satisfying about having an idea, and then getting to make it a reality. Getting hands-on experience with this piece of textual history puts into perspective a lot of my preconceived notions about what text is. During the lab, I really didn’t think much about the actual content of my poem just because I was way more excited about giving it a physical form than what it actually said. It made me think about all the ways I could be creative not just in how my text was written, but also in how it was actually presented, which could arguably make an even bigger impact on an audience or reader than content alone. It was definitely frustrating watching something I set fall apart, or realizing I forgot a comma and ripping apart my type just to add one. But that was also what gave me such a sense of accomplishment when I finally got my lines set and printed. I got to make something from scratch with my own hands, which made the experience feel really personal.Using the letterpress is truly one of the coolest things I have ever gotten to do for a class. There’s a new trend focused on the return of crafts like cross-stitching, bread baking, or calligraphy, but no one pays much attention to printing. Obviously it is not easy to get your hands on cases of fonts, furniture, and composing sticks, let alone the print itself, but I still think it could be better appreciated as an art form. Understanding what printers used to go through just to create single lines of text on a page definitely makes me feel grateful for technology, but also nostalgic for the past (which I wasn’t even around for but that’s unimportant). I have such an appreciation for the skill, knowledge, and artistry that goes into certain crafts, and printing is no different. There is so much to learn that I can easily see how someone could dedicate their entire life and career to mastering this trade. It honestly has inspired me to give some more hands-on crafting a try, even if it’s just making my own stickers or embroidering flowers onto my jeans.

## Analysis

Women have been defending their right to work as craftsmen since pretty much the beginning of time, and Emily Faithfull’s “Women Compositors” is a continuation of this struggle. Her argument that women are not only capable but skilled printers is something that I can really relate to this lab and to my everyday life. In the past, women having a trade, especially a trade as difficult to master as printing, was a challenge to the status quo. It meant that women could have their own businesses, control their own finances, and maybe even be better than men at something. Obviously this could not possibly happen, so the powerful men of the time argued:

		“That the business requires the application of a mechanical mind, 
		and that the female mind is not mechanical; that it is a 
		fatiguing, unhealthy trade, and that women, being physically 
		weaker than men would sooner sink under this fatigue and labor.”
		Of course, women fought back anyways, as illustrated by the fiery Faithfull. Women have a lot to offer in terms of perspective in the formation of creative works, and this includes printing. They must be willing to work against the odds, when the powerful male figures in society are expecting and even pushing them to fail. As Faithfull says, “women who become printers…must have the determination to make that sacrifice which can alone ensure the faithful discharge of their work.” When I was working on typesetting and especially when powering the printing press during this lab, I realized how difficult printing could be. But I also realized how meaningful it was to be a part of something that historically I would have been barred from, thanks to the women who fought back then for the right to work where they wanted to, doing what they wanted to.

On a similar note, it was also very meaningful to participate in a piece of history that is often cited as one of the most important inventions of our time. In The Machine that Made Us, Fry places the printing press at the same level of world-changing as the invention of fire and the wheel. At first I thought this was a bit exaggerated, but through the readings from these two weeks and the lab itself, I have a better understanding of everything that printing has changed for us. One thing that stood out in the film was the historical paper making method, involving breaking down old rags and using screens to form and dry sheets of paper. The machinery shown in that scene was huge, complicated, and likely required weeks to build – and that was for only one small portion of the end result. I know equally complicated processes go into creating ink, carving and casting fonts, and setting type. Watching Fry go through every agonizing step-by-step process that it would take to print just a single page put into perspective how little work we have to do now in order to get our content out into the world. It kind of makes me feel small to think about all the pieces that had to come together just so I could put a silly poem onto some paper, but it also makes me feel really appreciative for the experience.
