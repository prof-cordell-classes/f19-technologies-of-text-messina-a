# Lab Report: Zine You Around

#### ADRIANA MESSINA

## Process Description

We started the zine lab by learning how to fold an easy 8-page zine with an 8'' by 11'' sheet of paper. It was pretty easy and resulted in a really cute little book. That was really the only piece of formal instruction we were given. After folding our books, we were given free rein with scissors, glue, and lots of magazines. Many of the magazines were ones found for free on campus such as Spectrum. Some other included The New Yorker, Bon Appetit,and other magazines on various topics. They seemed to be mainly chosen for their bright imagery or interesting covers. These gave use a nice variety of fonts, images, and drawings to choose from for our zines.

I knew I wanted to make my zine about the music I've been listening to lately, so it was pretty easy for me to get started. I came up with a quick structure in my head: artist names for headings, then songs from each of their albums that I recommend. I began by cutting out letters for the cover, aptly titled "Fun rap music I've been listening to!" Then I cut out letters for my artists' names. I hand wrote the song titles on little strips of magazines that I felt reflected the general vibe of the artists or album.

## Observations

Half of the fun of this lab was making the zines with other people. All of us started off with some vague ideas about what we wanted to make, but being together helped us to really develop our ideas. We got to share the stories that had inspired our zines, and give each other advice on how to best construct their zine. We could also share supplies and help each other to find certain colors, letters, words, or photos in the magazines. Since zines are really about community, it was funnily appropriate to see us all come together to make our zines.

I was also struck by how cathartic making my zine was. It wasn't on a particularly personal topic, but it was still nice to get to make something that was all about me and my ideas. Being a college student, most of my writing is meant for a specific assignment or class. I typically don't get to choose my topics, or I am stuck in a really narrow range. But for my zine, I could make it about whatever I wanted. My ideas could be random, unrelated, or purely selfish, and no one could tell me not to include them. This sort of freedom really encouraged me to keep adding to my zine.

## Analysis

This lab really brought to mind Pagan's reflection on selfsihness in *'Zine*. She describes her goal in making her zines as, "to transform [her] boring life into an epic story." It was very refreshing to hear someone describe their writing as purely self serving. Zines seem to be the perfect community to talk about whatever you care about, and not worry about anything else. There are no deadlines, quotas, or grades to worry about; your only worry is getting acorss your message in the way you want to. Hearing about how Pagan had made zines as a way to express herself and grow her confidence encouraged me to do the same on the small scale during this lab. I got to talk about exactly what I wanted to, without worrying that people may judge me as being self-centered.

I was also reminded of Dorney's "6 Styles of Erasure Petry" during this lab. I'm a fan of erasure poetry and think it's really aesthetically beautiful. The piecemeal style of this kind of poetry lends itself well to the cut-and-paste methods of zine making. The sort of scrapbook style that zine artists often use small bits and pieces of text, photos, and drawings to create something greater than its parts. Similarly, blackout poetry takes puts parts in a different context to make something new and perhaps greater than the original.

I actually included some blackout poetry in my second unessay as an example of a strategy used in artists' books. It's something I'm glad I got to showcase, because its a medium I haven't used much in the past. There is something especially challenging in finding words in one poem to make an entirely new one. It was really fun to try something new, then to see it come up later in the class. It made me feel like I was making good connections between many of the concepts in the class. It is interesting to see how many of the topics we've covered overlap and interact. It can lead to complex combination of media which can send multi-faceted messages.
