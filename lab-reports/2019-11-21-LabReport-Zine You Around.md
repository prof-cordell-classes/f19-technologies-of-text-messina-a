# Lab Report: Zine You Around

#### ADRIANA MESSINA

## Process Description

We started the zine lab by learning how to fold an easy 8-page zine with an 8'' by 11'' sheet of paper. It was pretty easy and resulted in a really cute little book. That was really the only piece of formal instruction we were given. After folding our books, we were given free rein with scissors, glue, and lots of magazines. Many of the magazines were ones found for free on campus such as Spectrum. Some other included The New Yorker, Bon Appetit,and other magazines of various topics. These gave use a nice variety of fonts, images, and drawings to choose from for our zines.

I knew I wanted to make my zine about the music I've been listening to lately, so it was pretty easy for me to get started. I came up with a quick structure in my head: artist names for headings, then songs from each of their albums that I recommend. I began by cutting out letters for the cover, aptly titled "Fun rap music I've been listening to!" Then I cut out letters for my artists' names. I hand wrote the song titles on little strips of magazines that I felt reflected the general vibe of the artists or album.

## Observations

Half of the fun of this lab was making the zines with other people. All of us started off with some vague ideas about what we wanted to make, but being together helped us to really develop our ideas. We got to share the stories that had inspired our zines, and give each other advice on how to best construct their zine. We could also share supplies and help each other to find certain colors, letters, words, or photos in the magazines. Since zines are really about community, it was funnily appropriate to see us all come together to make our zines.

I was also struck by how cathartic making my zine was. It wasn't on a particularly personal topic, but it was still nice to get to make something that was all about me and my ideas. Being a college student, most of my writing is meant for a specific assignment or class. I typically don't get to choose my topics, or I am stuck in a really narrow range. But for my zine, I could make it about whatever I wanted. My ideas could be random, unrelated, or purely selfish, and no one could tell me not to include them. This sort of freedom really encouraged me to keep adding to my zine.

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the classâ€™ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one
