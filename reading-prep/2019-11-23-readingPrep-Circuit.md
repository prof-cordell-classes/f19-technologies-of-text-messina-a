# Reading Prep: Circuit

## Questions or Observations

1. I can't get over how much I absolutely loved Jon Bois' â€œWhat Football Will Look Like in the Future". I'm a huge fan of goofy, thought-provoking, uncanny-valley media (for example Jack Stauber, Bill Wurtz). Bois' piece captures that awesome balance between goofy fun and unsettling reflection on life itself. his writing is at once deeply meaningful and hilariously ridiculous. Using football as a jumping-off point is obviously highly creative, and created a really unique perspective to discuss the ideas of immortality and boredom in the face of eternity. It was a truly enjoyable experience and I can't wait to talk about it in class.
2. How does Bois' piece being multimedia contribute to its message? How does including text, digital, and video elements help deliver Bois' ideas?
3. One point I really liked in Mod's "Future Reading" was the idea of rereading as going back to our past selves. What books do you relate with a certain time period? How do you feel when you go back to them?
