## Questions or Observations

1. In the past, things like calligraphy, printing, and writing used to be seen as only for men (Faithfull), but are now seen as women's work/hobbies - when and why do you think this shift occurred?
2. In _Appeal_, author David Walker creates a clear connection between his oration and the physical form of print - does this kind of oration-to-print transfer still occur? Do emojis and other texting trends (saying lol, using ????, etc.) count?
3. What prints do you think we will determine as valuable enough to immortalize in history (like Gutenberg's Bible)? What books will we discard?
