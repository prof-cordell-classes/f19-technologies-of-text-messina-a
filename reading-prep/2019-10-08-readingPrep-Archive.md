## Questions or Observations

1. Mak's "Architectures of the Page" brought me back to one of our original class discussions in which we compared and contrasted ebooks and codices. In what way is the materiality of the page different electronically (say through a PDF like many of the class readings) than physically? Are the boundaires we set on technological pages even real?
2. What about English makes it such a globally used and accepted language? Is English going to overrun other languages and lead to the attrition of languages like Cherokee?
3. What are some new/modern words in the English lexicon that should be added to the dictionary? How would they be defined and preserved?
