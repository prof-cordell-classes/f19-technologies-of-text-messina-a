## Questions or Observations

1. Something that really caught my eye during the beginning of this book was the introduction of Queen Victoria and her perception of the difference engine. She seems really uncovinced of the machine's merit of a mathematical machine, becuase she feels it doens't have any real-life consequences or benefits. The only way Lovelace and Babbage are able to acquire more funding from her is to print her a kitten. Only then does she see some positive attributes to the groundbreaking machine. Babbage sees this as an insult, but it illustrates how a technology determines how it is used even moreso than its user decides how it is used.

2. I did not expect the format of this book to be a graphic novel, and it was certainly a pleasant surprise. I'm not very good at math and know next to nothing about programming, so I was concerned it would be a bit dry. But instead, this book has a lot of personality, fun asides, and interesting moments thanks to its illustrated delivery. The characters feel more real and interactive, which makes it easier to get inside their heads and understand the complex topics discussed in this book.

3.  What technologies are scoffed at that you think may be hugely important in the future? When is a time you've dismessed a new medium and then been proven wrong about its relevance and importance?
