## Questions or Observations

1. The idea of preservation vs. accessibility  is something I though about a lot while creating my artsits' books. I was concerned about my books falling apart before I could show them to my class, or about them lasting so that they could be used as examples in the future. I didn't realize that zines require the sane amount of thought. That balance between making something meaningful but ephemeral or pragmatic but practical is really tough to nail down. 
2. What are some other types of erasure poetry? How do new forms of technology give us an opportunity to make new kinds of poetry? I am mostly curious about hiding poetry in computer code/files.
3. I really want to make a zine now! I relate a lot to what Pagan said about always having to write a certain way; I also rarely have the chance to break the rules or write about myself, but it sounds so freeing. Her experience was really about community and I think that has a lot to do with the accessibility of zines and how personal they can feel. I think it'd be really cool to share with a community in a similar way.
