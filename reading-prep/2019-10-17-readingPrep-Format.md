# Reading Prep: Format

#### ADRIANA MESSINA
## Questions or Observations

1. Austen's Letters - Why are we as readers so often drawn to diaries? What about their format makes them so personal and fun to read?
2. Baxter's Procrustes - What a twist ending! The Bodelian Club's focus on materiality over content was ultimately their downfall in this case. Everyone was so afraid to open their books ands cut their pages that none of them noticed that Baxter's book was a sham! Honestly, I give credit to Baxter for being so clever and ultimately making something worth even more than an actual book with content. The novelty of his creation was a new concept that he took great advantage of.
3. Price talks about the "book reading"  gap between genders and how it changes over the years, but doesn't mention people outside of traditional gender binaries and norms. Do LGBT+ people (specifically trans and non-binary folx) understand reading differently than heterosexual cisgender men and women? Is there also a gap in literacy and accessibility?
