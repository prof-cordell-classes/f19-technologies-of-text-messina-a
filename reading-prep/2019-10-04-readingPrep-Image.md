## Questions or Observations

1. On page 147 of *The Book*, Borsuk says, "Books are always a negotiation, a performance, an event." This quote relaly stuck out to me because personally, some of my favorite books (most notably Bosch's secret series) were not just about their content but about how the reader themself interacted with the book. I would like to talk about other times my classmates have experienced this sense of not just reading, but engaging with a book.


2. Looking through the different versions of Blake's _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_, I noticed that Copy H had text of many different colors, while Copy F only had text in one color. How does this change the textual impact? Does it make the content stronger or weaker?


3. Viscomi's *Illuminated Printing* claims that Blake started with printing his text and then illustrated around it, which is definitely evident in _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_. How does this idea of illustrating in a book's negative space echo the way people in the past would write in the margins of their books? Are the effects/reasoning the same?
