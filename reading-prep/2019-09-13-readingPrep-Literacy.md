# Reading Prep: CHAPTER 2 - LITERACY

#### ADRIANA MESSINA

## My 3 Questions

1. In the past, socially defined "illiteracy" was used as an excuse to oppress disadvantaged peoples. Does programming as literacy continue this pattern or is it a force for equal opportunity?
2. Reading used to be considered "elite" and "monastic". Changes in its form and context are what allowed literature to become private and standardized. What changes do you think could occur/haveoccured to make literature public once again?
3. Why were so many of the changes in text/literature influenced by or created for the purpose of recording sacred texts? (ie the Bible, the Torah, the Quran)
