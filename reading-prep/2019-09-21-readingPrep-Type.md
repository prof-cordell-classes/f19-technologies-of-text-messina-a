# Reading Prep: Chp. 3 - Type

#### Adriana Messina

## Questions or Observations

1. Typeface/font may affect how we read or interpret a piece of text, but does it also affect how we write? Does writing in one typface versus another change our style choices or how we perceive our own writing techniques?


2. Based on Renaud's experiences with the relationship between his essay grades and his font choices, what fonts do you think would lead to the best grades, and in which classes? Is one font better for an engineering course versus a history course?


3. Why do you think there are no written records or illustrations of the constructuion of Gutenberg's original printing press?
