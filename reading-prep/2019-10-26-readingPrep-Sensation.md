# Reading Prep: Sensation

## Questions or Observations

1. I thought Uzanne's "The End of Books" reading was really reminscient to a lot of the discourse we hear currently. People have been trying to predict the future for pretty much all time, but our predicitons have rarely been correct. Most of the time, we overshoot how far technology will travel, and I think Uzanne falls into the same trap here. While things like podcasts and audiobooks are prevalent, books are not going anywhere anytime soon. This doesn't make the prediction useless though - a lot of Uzanne's points are accurate predictions of general trends for books. The same concept applies to past predictions; they might not be completely correct but they offer a lot of insight into what our priorities and beliefs were in the past.
2. What enexpected/creative adaptive technology that have you seen? Where do you think concepts like Hendren's could be applied?
3. How does the story of line type and Samuel Howe reveal the issues thata rise when able-bodied people design technology for the disabled?
